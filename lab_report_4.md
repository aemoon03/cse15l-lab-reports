  Keys Pressed: `cd l, <tab>, enter, ctrl + r, javac, enter, ctrl + r, T, enter`\
  in order to cd into the cloned repository, I needed to cd into the lab7 folder, which I autocompleted by pressing tab after the first lowercase l. The javac command to compile the files was already in the history from having used it previously, so I used `Ctrl + R` to access it. The command to run the TestListExamples file was already in the history from having used it previously, so I used `Ctrl + R` to access it.\

  the nano command was already in the history from having used it previously, so I used `Ctrl + R` to access it. once in nano, I pressed `ctrl + w` to find the first instance of index1, and then used the arrow keys down to the bug, replaced index1 with index2, and then pressed `ctrl + o` to save the changes, pressed enter, and then pressed `ctrl + x` to exit nano.\

  Keys Pressed: `git add ., ctrl + r, com, <enter>, git push`\
  in order to add, I believed that I could just type `git add .` fast enough and accurately enough without having to use any commands. because the commit command was already in the history from having used it previously, I used `Ctrl + R` to access it, and then likewise with add, i believed that I could type `git push` fast enough and accurately enough without having to warrant using any commands.
